                                A highly decorated stalwart in the Indian Telecom space was going through a bit of a rut in terms of formulating a high-efficient entry-level talent acquisition strategy. The client provides voice and high-speed internet services over fiber optics, copper and fixed wireless systems.

                            <p>It is widely acknowledged that a company of Stakefield’s reputation and presence, needs to go through a number of permutations and combinations while staging a mass recruitment process for our clients. The process includes a lot of management tasks such as looking after the entire recruitment needs of the client, arranging walk-in/drives along with providing best sourcing strategies to maintain consistency and competitiveness. The team at Stakefields works in tandem with the Talent Acquisition Managers of our clients in order to accurately gauge hiring requirements, perform career profiling, devise strategies and selection procedures to maximize the number of successful prospects. We have a dedicated team of recruitment experts to handle your Mass Hiring needs at all times.

                The key addition in terms of value proposition for our client, comes in the form of our industrial training ecosystem, coined LearningBerg, that HashRoot has extensively leveraged to fulfill upskilling/reskilling requirements of varied industries. HashRoot’s standing arrangements and knowledge partnerships with a multitude of organizations; private and public sectors alike, has been the cornerstone to develop industry-relevant training programs and digital content for applicants who we source for our clients.</p>
                       <p>
                        These applicants are then trained, pertinent to their desired job roles and client requirements through our digital platform before they can be deemed job-ready. Our show of expertise in this regard can be highlighted through a case we have built for one of our most important clients in the telecom space.

                                With companies shifting to remote work arrangements, many people opted to sign up for internet service, thereby resulting in a significant boost in their customer base. As a result, the team handling customer service, sales support and management tasks are required to work double-time performing data management, order processing, account reconciliation, and answering customer service calls.
                               </p>
                       <p>
                        These tasks created a bottleneck for the client in providing support for their existing customers, thereby restricting their ability to acquire more customers. Finding and recruiting qualified customer service representatives and technical support staff proved extremely tedious, time consuming and expensive.
