                                reputation and presence, needs to go
                                through a number of permutations and combinations while staging a mass recruitment

                                client, comes in the form of our industrial
                                training ecosystem, coined LearningBerg, that HashRoot has extensively leveraged to
                                fulfill
                                upskilling/reskilling requirements of varied industries. HashRoot’s standing

                                the cornerstone to develop industry-relevant training programs and digital content for
                                applicants
                                who we source for our clients. </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">These applicants are then trained, pertinent to their

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">A highly decorated stalwart in the Indian Telecom space was
                                going through a bit of a rut in terms of
                                formulating a high-efficient entry-level talent acquisition strategy. The client
                                provides voice and
                                high-speed internet services over fiber optics, copper and fixed wireless systems.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">With companies shifting to remote work arrangements, many
                                people opted to sign up for internet
                                service, thereby resulting in a significant boost in their customer base. As a result,
                                the team handling
                                customer service, sales support and management tasks are required to work double-time
                                performing
                                data management, order processing, account reconciliation, and answering customer
                                service calls.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;"> These tasks created a bottleneck for the client in
                                providing support for their existing customers,
                                thereby restricting their ability to acquire more customers. Finding and recruiting
                                qualified
                                customer service representatives and technical support staff proved extremely tedious,

                                consuming and expensive.</p>

                                with the client in developing a co-sourcing solution that involved 3 weeks of extensive

                                work in a timely manner. As a result, customer satisfaction increased by 90% and productivity by

                                customers and important business activities that will help them expand its reach in the
                                telecommunications market.
