                                                    managing some of the most difficult and sophisticated projects. Our team's biggest asset is the sheer
                                                    lack of insecurity that would allow them to experiment and work creatively. Our leader will not stay
                                                    back as knowing everything but will create harmony and trust within a team. Our leadership style is
                                                    that we allow team members to hog the attention and the leader will understand the unique working
                                                    style of each of his members and will abstain always from imposing generic, restricting diktats.
                                                    We always create an ambiance of positivity in the most adverse of circumstances. Our leadership
                                                    style will instill a value called "consistency of purpose". Our leadership style is that we encourage
                                                    our leaders to take courageous decisions.
