                                business. But when we look at the world around us, many of the issues we
                                identified in our early sustainability reports remain challenges not only for
                                our business but for the broader community. We have also seen new issues
                                emerge. Business as usual, even a more sustainable business, as usual, is not
                                enough. Whilst we will continue with the actions we were quick to embed,
                                such as sustainable sourcing practices and responsible lending and
                                investment policies, we’re increasing our efforts on the emerging societal
                                issues where we have unique skills and expertise to bring about meaningful
                                change. Our people are passionate about it because it makes sense for our
                                business because it’s part of who we are because we know that tomorrow
                                won’t wait.</p>
